# Schema.org Search Tool

This application is part of the [Stanford CEDAR](https://metadatacenter.org/) supplement project that can be used to search and filter [schema.org](http://health-lifesci.schema.org/MedicalEntity) annotated biomedical resources (datasets, tools, data).

The main user interface uses faceted browsing - a user-interface technique for accessing data organized in categorical structures. Faceted browsing allows users to explore a collection of datasets dynamically by combining metadata search terms with filters on metadata attributes and their values. 

Visit the [demo application](https://schemaorg.metadatacenter.org/search/) at our site.
